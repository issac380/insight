Table Schema:
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS exited_items
    RFID_Tag TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    Product_Name TEXT,
    Price REAL,
    Detected_At TIMESTAMP,
    Status TEXT,
    Current_Security TEXT

    Status == unresolved    üö® Item detected as unpaid but no action taken yet (default on detection)
              reported	    üìÑ LLM report has been generated and logged
              investigating	üïµÔ∏è Manual review or further action in progress
              resolved	    ‚úÖ Case closed (e.g., false alarm, item recovered, or paid afterward)
              dismissed	    ‚ùå Ignored case (e.g., known issue, test scan)
              paid          Item is paid

Ideal Workflow:
    Insertion:              All entries will be inserted by calling "db_handler.record_unpaid_item()" as UNRESOLVED
    Report Generation:      Incident reports will be created in real time by incident_report.{FUNC NAME}()
                            This function will change the status of this record to REPORTED via db_handler.update_record_status_by_rfid()
    Report Acknowledgement: When the incident report is received by the human manager, this record will be labeled as INVESTIGATING
    Resolution:             Humans will manually mark entry as RESOLVED 
    Dismissal:              Humans will manually mark entry as DISMISSED 
    TODO: Last 3 workflow are currently not implemented. Function endpoints will be added later.
